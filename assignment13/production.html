          Issac started producing in early 2022, taking inspiration from
          producers like Pharell, Benjicold, Mally Raw, and more. While he
          started making beats as a hobby, and didn't take it too seriously, its
          now one of his favorite things to do and allows him to wrok with
          several other artists and spread his work further than ever before.
          This first video is a recent beat made in October 2023. It combines
          many different sounds from synths to flutes with some hard hitting and
          unique drums to make a different kind of sound. It features one of the
          key element in issac's beats, a unique accent bass sound in the
          bassline. He also likes to use any other kinds of unorthodox sounds
          for the bass line in songs. The second is a beat made in mid 2022,
          helping us see the progression over these 2 years of producing. It
          features some bells and a distinct lead throughout the song. The final
          track is from early 2022, featuring the first beat ever produced by
          Issac, a significant step in his musical journey. while its nothing
          special now, the simplicity of his initial beat can still be
          appreciated. This song is a important point in Issac's growth as an
          artist since his first foray into music production.
