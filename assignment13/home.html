        <p class="sc">
          In 2022, Issac released a drum and bass remix of "Nun to Me" by
          Kankan. The remix featured the typical fast tempo and breaks of the
          drum and bass genre, while preserving the original melody of the song.
          This work added a new dimension to Isaac's portfolio and was
          well-received by fans of both Kankan and the dnb genre. It was a
          notable project in Issac's career as it gained more attention than any
          other song at the time.

          This track is from early 2022, featuring the first beat ever produced
          by Issac, a significant step in his musical journey. while its nothing
          special now, the simplicity of his initial beat can still be
          appreciated. This song is a important point in Issac's growth as an
          artist since his first foray into music production.

          This is a concept cover I worked on with a friend for a project. It
          was a good opportunity to learn many things about the process of
          making artwork.
